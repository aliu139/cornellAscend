	<h1>Professional Development</h1>
	<p> Professional Development Committee aims to provide professional networks for Ascend members. Together with our alumni, we offer mentorship programs and regional network events. We are also responsible for building and maintaining relationships with other Ascend chapters and other professional organizations. Working with Career Development Committee, we invite guest speakers to our series and provide any other resources that will help students to explore and grow.</p>
